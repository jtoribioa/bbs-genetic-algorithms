## Motivation
* Highly probable to deal with optimization challenges in business units.
* Deterministic approach is viable in small data set optimization problems (e.g. Knapsack Problem with 4 items) and always offers the best solution.
* Metaheuristics obtain approximated solutions and have faster execution time and lower computational resources requirements.
* Real world optimization challenges are complex and involve many features and constraints (e.g. Operating Room Scheduling).
* Metaheuristics are suitable for this kind of problems.
